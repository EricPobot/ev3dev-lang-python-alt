The Grabber captures colored bricks placed on its path, and bring them back to
a location depending on their color.

It provides feedback of its detections and actions by LEDs animations and
spoken sentences. It also displays some fancy drawings on the LCD screen.

It uses the three motors of the EV3 kit, a touch sensor and a color sensor.
Its design is loosely based on the Gripp3r model.
